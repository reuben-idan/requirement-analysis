## 📋 About the Project

The **Requirement Analysis Project** focuses on crafting a comprehensive foundation for software development by documenting, analyzing, and structuring requirements. Through a series of well-defined tasks, learners will create a detailed blueprint of the requirement analysis phase for a **booking management system**.

This project simulates a real-world development scenario, emphasizing clarity, precision, and structure in defining requirements to set the stage for successful project execution.

### 🎯 Learning Objective

The objective of this project is to enhance a professional developer's ability to:

- ✅ **Master** the principles and methodologies of Requirement Analysis in the software development lifecycle (SDLC)
- ✅ **Efficiently translate** project needs into structured documentation
- ✅ **Identify and categorize** functional and non-functional requirements for scalable systems
- ✅ **Leverage tools** like Draw.io for visual representation of system requirements
- ✅ **Establish clear acceptance criteria** to ensure alignment with business and user goals
- ✅ **Apply best practices** to produce industry-standard documentation and diagrams
